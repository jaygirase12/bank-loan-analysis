# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard Project

## 🧠 Project Summary
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using Excel dashboards. It visualizes loan application trends, financial metrics, risk segmentation, and borrower profiles to support strategic decision-making.

## 📁 Files Included
- `kpis.md`: Key performance indicators extracted from both dashboards.
- `ai_summary.txt`: AI-generated summary with actionable insights.
- `Bank loan analysis.xlsx`: Raw data and dashboard visuals.


## 📌 Key Insights
- 38.6K loan applications analyzed with 86% classified as good loans.
- $435.8M funded and $473.1M received for good loans.
- Grade-based interest rates and DTI ratios highlight risk tiers.
- Debt consolidation is the top loan purpose.
- Renters dominate the applicant pool, with higher default risk.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Dashboarding, Pivot Charts, Conditional Formatting)
- AI Copilot (Insight generation, KPI extraction)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open `Bank loan analysis.xlsx` to explore interactive dashboards.
2. Review `kpis.md` for quick performance metrics.
3. Read `ai_summary.txt` for strategic recommendations.
4. Use insights to guide lending policies, risk assessment, and product design.


## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out
- Clean dashboard design with intuitive layout
- Actionable insights backed by data
- Grade-wise risk profiling and segmentation
- Ready-to-deploy format for presentations or stakeholder review
